{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otter_(dinghy)", "content": " is a classification referring to a particular design for a two-man  with a glass fibre hull. Its rig consists of a main, a jib and an optional symmetric spinnaker. The hull dimensions are 11\u00a0ft 11 in length and 4\u00a0ft 10 in beam. The boat has a draft of 3\u00a0ft 6 in with the centreboard down. The sail area (main and jib) is 75 sq. ft. The class symbol is a stylised glass bubble; due to the original lightweight \"cigar box cedar\" construction of the prototypes, the name 'Bubble' was first used for the boat. John Baker obtained the plans for an expanded version of the boat in G.R.P. and hence renamed the boat 'Glass Bubble'. After being put into production by Baker, the name 'Otter' was adopted; coming from the river of the same name in East Devon, close to where the boat was manufactured.The Otter also handles well and can be sailed with larger crews than the two man racing crew. The boats are also incredibly easy to sail single handed as well. However, when sailing with more than two people the boat does tend to sit quite low in the water and does affect the performance of the dinghy.The Otter was originally designed by George O'Brien Kennedy for G.R.P.

It was designed with well-dispersed structures: doubled-up transmitter and receiver blocks, a substation and a standby set house in earth-bound bunkers, four 325ft steel transmitter aerial masts and two 240ft self-supporting timber receiver aerial towers.  Ringstead Chain Home was stood down in 1945. In 1952, the former Chain Home station was refurbished into a  site (known as SRD). The Rotor programme was developed to update previous wartime radar technology and to install more capable radar systems to detect and locate fast-flying jets.

In early use, the term denoted the state of being a citizen and hence good citizenship or orderly behavior. The sense \"politeness\" arose in the mid-16th century.Adolf G. Gundersen and Suzanne Goodney Lea developed a civility model grounded in empirical data that \"stresses the notion that civility is a sequence, not a single thing or set of things\". The model conceives of civility as a continuum or scale consisting of increasingly demanding traits ranging from \"indifference\" to \"commentary\", \"conversation\", \"co-exploration\" and, from there, to \"habituation\". According to the authors, such a developmental model has several advantages, not least of which is that it allows civility to be viewed as something everyone can get better at.Many experts say civility goes beyond good manners and listening attentively, but includes sharing our own beliefs and values with others through some type of engagement with the intent of sincere respect towards one another.
